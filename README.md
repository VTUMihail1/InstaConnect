A microservices-based social media platform for connecting and sharing content.

## Architecture

InstaConnect is made up of four independently deployable services behind an nginx gateway. Services communicate asynchronously through RabbitMQ events.

| Service | Responsibility | Gateway route |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | Users, authentication (JWT + refresh tokens), email confirmation, password reset | `/identity/` |
| **Posts** | Posts, comments and likes | `/posts/` |
| **Chats** | Chats and real-time messaging (SignalR) | `/chats/` |
| **Follows** | Follower relationships and real-time follow notifications (SignalR) | `/follows/` |

Each service follows Clean Architecture, split into `Domain`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`, `Presentation` and `Events` projects, with code organised by feature. Shared building blocks live in `src/Common`.

**Tech stack:** ASP.NET Core, MediatR, FluentValidation, Mapster, MassTransit + RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Redis, SignalR, OpenTelemetry + Serilog (Grafana LGTM), xUnit, NSubstitute, FluentAssertions, Testcontainers.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) matching [global.json](global.json) (only needed to build or test outside Docker)
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account
- A [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) account

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VTUMihail1/InstaConnect.git
   cd InstaConnect
   ```

2. Create a `docker/.env` file from the template and fill in your values:

   ```bash
   cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
   ```

| Endpoint | URL |
|---|---|
| API gateway | http://localhost |
| Grafana (logs, traces, metrics) | http://localhost:3000 |
| RabbitMQ management | http://localhost:15672 |

## Development

```bash
dotnet tool restore                # install local tools (dotnet-retest, reportgenerator)
dotnet build InstaConnect.sln
dotnet test InstaConnect.sln       # integration tests need Docker running (Testcontainers)
dotnet format InstaConnect.sln     # apply code style
```

Tests are split into `*.Tests.Unit`, `*.Tests.Integration` and `*.Tests.Functional` projects per layer. Projects ending in just `.Tests` hold shared test utilities.
